# mc-ceramics
 
A website made for my dad to show off his pottery, link to his Etsy page, and talk about his workshop sessions.

A simple website made with Angular to comply with my dad's requirements (all his design!). The page is responsive and should (hopefully) be accessible on mobile. 

Deployed and hosted on Firebase with a Google domain.
