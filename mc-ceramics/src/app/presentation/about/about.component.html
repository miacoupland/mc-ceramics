  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Art has always featured in my life, having parents whose hobbies were
      painting and gardening. I was lucky to get a brief exposure to the world
      of ceramics during my teen years this was followed many years later by two
      years of evening classes at Lincoln Art College. On retirement from the
      NHS I joined a regular class at the Oxcombe Ceramic Studio in the Wolds
      where we exchange ideas and discuss ceramics most weeks.
      <br /><br />
      My home studio was developed during the Covid Crisis which was the
      catalyst to bring forward plans for converting part of our cartshed /
      garage into a studio. Teaching was always part of my NHS life including an
      MSc in adult education completed through Sheffield Hallam Uni. Therefore,
      the studio was designed with room for two wheels and the option of some
      further teaching / demonstrating of a non clinical nature. Most (but not
      all) of the work created in the studio is intended to have a functional
      use but also to hopefully be aesthetically pleasing and tactile.
      <br /><br />
      I think all those working with ceramics marvel at the infinite variety of
      glaze finishes that result from the mix of “earth and fire” this is
      undoubtedly the attraction, charm and frustration of pottery. We gain
      inspiration from other potters and from interactions in life and the
      natural world. Please feel free to contact me at my email below if you
      want “to have a go”.
